ðŸŒŸ Stripe Subscription Flow
To implement a seamless subscription-based payment system using Stripe, follow these steps:

1. ðŸ“¦ Create a Product
Define your product or subscription plan in Stripe using stripe.products.create(). This represents the offering you want to charge your users for, like a subscription plan.

2. ðŸ’¸ Create a Price
Set up pricing for the product using stripe.prices.create(). Specify the price, currency, and billing intervals (e.g., monthly, yearly, or custom durations).

3. ðŸ‘¤ Create a Customer
Register the customer in Stripe using stripe.customers.create(). This allows you to associate payments and subscriptions with a specific user.

4. ðŸ›’ Create a Checkout Session
Generate a session for the customer to complete their payment securely using stripe.checkout.sessions.create(). This session provides a payment link for the customer.

5. ðŸ”„ Create a Subscription
After payment completion, create a subscription using stripe.subscriptions.create(). This sets up a recurring billing schedule based on the selected productâ€™s price and billing interval.

6. ðŸ“¬ Handle Webhooks
Set up Stripe webhooks to listen for important events like checkout.session.completed or customer.subscription.created. This ensures real-time updates to your system, allowing you to track subscription status changes.
